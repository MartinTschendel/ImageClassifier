# ImageClassifier

Here I built a deep convolutional neural network that can classify photos of dogs and cats.<br>
It is inspired by the tutorial ["How to Classify Photos of Dogs and Cats"](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-convolutional-neural-network-to-classify-photos-of-dogs-and-cats/#comment-597191) from Jason Brownlee
