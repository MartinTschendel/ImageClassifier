# ImageClassifier

Here I built a deep convolutional neural network that can classify photos of dogs and cats.<br>
It is inspired by the tutorial ["How to Classify Photos of Dogs and Cats"](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-convolutional-neural-network-to-classify-photos-of-dogs-and-cats/#comment-597191) from Jason Brownlee.<br>
The model is trained on a dataset of totally 10,000 pictures of dogs and cats, that is taken from the udemy course "Machine Learning A-Z".
